## 1. Introduction to Alpha Rays

Alpha rays, also known as alpha particles or alpha radiation, are a form of ionizing radiation consisting of helium-4 nuclei. These particles are composed of two protons and two neutrons bound together, making them identical to the nucleus of a helium atom. Alpha radiation is one of the three primary types of radiation discovered in the early studies of radioactivity, alongside beta and gamma radiation.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Composition**: 2 protons + 2 neutrons
- **Charge**: +2 elementary charges
- **Mass**: Approximately 4 atomic mass units (6.64 × 10^-27 kg)
- **Symbol**: α (alpha) or ⁴₂He²⁺

## 2. Discovery and History

### Timeline of Discovery:
- **1896**: Henri Becquerel discovers radioactivity
- **1898**: Marie and Pierre Curie isolate radium and polonium
- **1899**: Ernest Rutherford identifies and names alpha and beta radiation
- **1907**: Rutherford proves alpha particles are helium nuclei
- **1911**: Rutherford's gold foil experiment using alpha particles leads to the nuclear model of the atom

### Historical Significance:
Ernest Rutherford's work with alpha particles fundamentally changed our understanding of atomic structure. His famous gold foil experiment, where alpha particles were fired at a thin gold foil, revealed that atoms have a dense, positively charged nucleus at their center.

## 3. Physical Properties

### Mass and Size:
- **Mass**: 6.644657230 × 10^-27 kg
