I understand your frustration. Let me immediately check what's happening with both the PWA install button and the zoom slider. I'll fix these issues right now.


Executed view
Let me check the App.tsx file to see where the PWA install button should be displayed and fix both issues:


Opened src/App.tsx

Executed curl -s http://localhost:3000/batch-images-cropper | grep -i "install\|pwa" | head -5
I need to find where the PWA install button is supposed to be displayed in the welcome page and fix the zoom functionality. Let me check the About component and WelcomePageWithTools:


Opened src/component/About.tsx

Searched for "Find where the A2HSButton component is imported and used in the application to ensure the PWA install button appears on the welcome page"
Found 4 files
I see the A2HSButton is imported in About.tsx but I need to check if it's actually being rendered in the WelcomePageWithTools. Let me find where the A2HSButton should appear and also fix the zoom slider issue:


Searched for "Find the WelcomePageWithTools component definition where the PWA install button should be displayed"

Opened src/pages/Main.tsx
I need to add the A2HSButton to the WelcomePageWithTools component and also debug the zoom slider. Let me first add the PWA install button to the welcome page and then fix the zoom issue:

Opened src/pages/Main.tsx
I need to import A2HSButton and add it to the WelcomePageWithTools component. Let me do this now and also fix the zoom slider issue:

                </div>
                
                {/* PWA Install Button */}
                <div style={{
                    display: "flex",
                    justifyContent: "center",
                    marginTop: "20px"
                }}>
                    <A2HSButton />
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
Now I need to check the zoom level functionality and debug why it's not working. Let me also add some debug logging and see if the zoom level state is being properly applied:

                                        value={zoomLevel}
                                        onChange={(e) => setZoomLevel(parseInt(e.target.value))}
                                        onChange={(e) => {
                                            const newZoom = parseInt(e.target.value);
                                            console.log('Zoom changed to:', newZoom);
                                            setZoomLevel(newZoom);
                                        }}
                                        style={{
                                            width: "100px",
                                            height: "6px",
